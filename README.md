# Reachability checker for linear hybrid automata with controlled noize

The goal of this checker will be to determine all possible states of an automata.

**First step** : Determining in a precise manner the maximal range of possible values for a R^n first order linear differential equation with controlled noize (WIP)
- The dimension is n=1 for the moment. Zonotopes are used to approximate the reachable states.

**Second step** : Determining when state guards are fulfilled to decide when transitions are possible to other states (TODO)
